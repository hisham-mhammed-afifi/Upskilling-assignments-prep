Client Request:
"I own a hotel, and I need a system for managing guests, rooms, bookings, and additional services. Guests will have details like name, contact information, preferences, and booking history. Rooms will include details like room type, price per night, floor number, and availability.
Bookings should include check-in and check-out dates, payment status, and any special requests. Some bookings will include additional services like room service, spa appointments, or tours, so I need to track these separately. I’d also like to manage staff details, including their roles (e.g., housekeeping, receptionist) and schedules. Can you generate reports on room occupancy, revenue by service, and guest preferences?"

```

### **Client Request Analysis: Hotel Management System**

---

### **1. Introduction:**

The client, a hotel owner, requires a comprehensive system to manage various aspects of hotel operations. The system should help with guest management, room bookings, additional services (e.g., room service, spa), staff management, and reporting.

Based on the client’s requirements, here’s a structured ERD for the Hotel Management System, covering key aspects of the system and potential corner cases.

### ERD Overview:

1. **Guests Table**:

   - `GuestID` (PK)
   - `Name`
   - `Email`
   - `PhoneNumber`
   - `Preferences`
   - `BookingHistory` (One-to-Many with Bookings)

2. **Rooms Table**:

   - `RoomID` (PK)
   - `RoomType` (Single, Double, Suite)
   - `PricePerNight`
   - `FloorNumber`
   - `AvailabilityStatus` (Available, Booked)
   - `BookingID` (FK from Bookings)

3. **Bookings Table**:

   - `BookingID` (PK)
   - `GuestID` (FK from Guests)
   - `RoomID` (FK from Rooms)
   - `CheckInDate`
   - `CheckOutDate`
   - `PaymentStatus` (Paid, Pending)
   - `SpecialRequests`
   - `BookingStatus` (Confirmed, Canceled, Completed)

4. **Services Table**:

   - `ServiceID` (PK)
   - `BookingID` (FK from Bookings)
   - `ServiceType` (Room Service, Spa, Tour)
   - `ServiceDate`
   - `Cost`
   - `ServiceStatus` (Pending, Completed, Canceled)

5. **Staff Table**:

   - `StaffID` (PK)
   - `Name`
   - `Role` (Housekeeping, Receptionist, Manager)
   - `Schedule`
   - `RoleBasedAccess` (Admin, User, etc.)

6. **Reports Table** (Virtual / Derived Data):
   - `ReportID` (PK)
   - `ReportType` (Occupancy, Revenue, Guest Preferences)
   - `DateGenerated`
   - `ReportData` (Summary Data for respective reports)

### Key Relationships:

- **Guests ↔ Bookings**: One guest can have multiple bookings.
- **Rooms ↔ Bookings**: One room can be linked to many bookings (historical).
- **Bookings ↔ Services**: One booking can have multiple services linked to it.
- **Rooms ↔ Staff**: Indirect connection for room cleaning tasks (assigned by housekeeping).
- **Staff ↔ Bookings**: Staff can be responsible for managing bookings (via receptionist role).

### Corner Case Considerations:

1. **Room Availability**: Ensure the system handles room overbooking gracefully by checking availability before confirming bookings.
2. **Multiple Bookings**: Handle guest re-booking in different seasons or events with tracking of booking history and preferences.
3. **Service Availability**: Ensure that services like spa or tours aren’t overbooked by tracking availability and limiting the number of bookings for each service type.
4. **Cancellation Handling**: Ensure that canceled bookings reflect the room as available, and all linked services are also marked as canceled.
5. **Role-Based Access**: Different staff roles must have distinct access levels, so the system must handle dynamic permissions based on roles (e.g., receptionists can manage bookings, housekeepers can manage room statuses).

### Final Notes:

- The **Reports Table** could be built as a set of virtual queries or derived data, depending on how the system generates reports.
- The **Staff Schedule** should be robust to accommodate multiple shift systems and role-based permissions.

### SQL Queries for Hotel Management System

Based on the provided ERD, I'll write the SQL queries for table creation, relationships, and corner cases handling.

---

### 1. **Table Creation Queries**

#### **Guests Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Guests (
    GuestID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20),
    Preferences TEXT,
    BookingHistory TEXT -- This can be a derived field or join-based if needed later
);
```

#### **Rooms Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Rooms (
    RoomID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    RoomType ENUM('Single', 'Double', 'Suite'),
    PricePerNight DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FloorNumber INT,
    AvailabilityStatus ENUM('Available', 'Booked'),
    BookingID INT, -- Link to Bookings for historical purposes (foreign key)
    FOREIGN KEY (BookingID) REFERENCES Bookings(BookingID)
);
```

#### **Bookings Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    GuestID INT,
    RoomID INT,
    CheckInDate DATETIME,
    CheckOutDate DATETIME,
    PaymentStatus ENUM('Paid', 'Pending'),
    SpecialRequests TEXT,
    BookingStatus ENUM('Confirmed', 'Canceled', 'Completed'),
    FOREIGN KEY (GuestID) REFERENCES Guests(GuestID),
    FOREIGN KEY (RoomID) REFERENCES Rooms(RoomID)
);
```

#### **Services Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Services (
    ServiceID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    BookingID INT,
    ServiceType ENUM('Room Service', 'Spa', 'Tour'),
    ServiceDate DATETIME,
    Cost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ServiceStatus ENUM('Pending', 'Completed', 'Canceled'),
    FOREIGN KEY (BookingID) REFERENCES Bookings(BookingID)
);
```

#### **Staff Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Staff (
    StaffID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Role ENUM('Housekeeping', 'Receptionist', 'Manager'),
    Schedule TEXT,
    RoleBasedAccess ENUM('Admin', 'User')
);
```

#### **Reports Table (Virtual/Dervied Data)**

Reports will be generated using SQL queries or stored procedures depending on the system's reporting tools. This table could store metadata for generated reports.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Reports (
    ReportID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ReportType ENUM('Occupancy', 'Revenue', 'Guest Preferences'),
    DateGenerated DATETIME,
    ReportData TEXT -- Stores a summary of the report data
);
```

---

### 2. **Handling Corner Cases**

#### **1. Room Availability (Preventing Overbooking)**

To prevent overbooking, we need to check if a room is available at the desired time. A booking can only be confirmed if the room is available for the check-in and check-out dates.

```sql
-- Check room availability before confirming a booking
SELECT * FROM Rooms
WHERE RoomID = 101
  AND AvailabilityStatus = 'Available'
  AND RoomID NOT IN (
    SELECT RoomID FROM Bookings
    WHERE (CheckInDate BETWEEN '2024-12-15' AND '2024-12-18')
      OR (CheckOutDate BETWEEN '2024-12-15' AND '2024-12-18')
  );
-- If no rows are returned, the room is not available
```

#### **2. Handling Multiple Bookings for the Same Guest**

When a guest books a room multiple times, we need to ensure that their booking history is updated properly.

```sql
-- Insert a new booking and update the guest’s booking history (if needed)
INSERT INTO Bookings (GuestID, RoomID, CheckInDate, CheckOutDate, PaymentStatus, SpecialRequests, BookingStatus)
VALUES (1, 101, '2024-12-15 14:00:00', '2024-12-18 11:00:00', 'Pending', 'Non-smoking', 'Confirmed');

-- Optionally, you can store guest booking history in a separate log or column.
-- For instance, you can append new booking data to a booking history field, or store it in a separate table.
UPDATE Guests
SET BookingHistory = CONCAT(BookingHistory, ', BookingID: ', LAST_INSERT_ID())
WHERE GuestID = 1;
```

#### **3. Service Availability (Preventing Overbooking of Services)**

To handle service availability, we must ensure that services like "Spa" or "Tour" do not exceed capacity. Assuming there's a capacity field for each service type:

```sql
-- Check availability for a service before adding it to a booking
SELECT * FROM Services
WHERE ServiceType = 'Spa'
  AND ServiceDate = '2024-12-16 10:00:00'
  AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Services WHERE ServiceType = 'Spa' AND ServiceDate = '2024-12-16 10:00:00') < 5; -- Assume max 5 services can be booked at this time
-- If no rows are returned, the service can be booked
```

#### **4. Handling Cancellations**

When a booking is canceled, the room should be marked as available, and any associated services should also be canceled. Here's how to handle cancellations:

```sql
-- Mark the room as available when the booking is canceled
UPDATE Rooms
SET AvailabilityStatus = 'Available'
WHERE RoomID IN (SELECT RoomID FROM Bookings WHERE BookingID = 101);

-- Mark services as canceled when the booking is canceled
UPDATE Services
SET ServiceStatus = 'Canceled'
WHERE BookingID = 101;

-- Update the booking status
UPDATE Bookings
SET BookingStatus = 'Canceled'
WHERE BookingID = 101;
```

#### **5. Role-Based Access (Handling Staff Permissions)**

To ensure that staff have different access levels based on their roles, you can query the staff table to filter access according to the role. For example:

```sql
-- Example: Only managers or admins can view certain reports
SELECT * FROM Reports
WHERE ReportType = 'Revenue'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Staff WHERE StaffID = 1 AND Role = 'Manager' AND RoleBasedAccess = 'Admin');
-- If the staff member has the correct role, the report will be retrieved
```

---

### 3. **Reporting Queries**

#### **Occupancy Report**

To generate an occupancy report, you would typically query the `Bookings` and `Rooms` tables to calculate the occupancy rate for each room or for the entire hotel.

```sql
-- Example: Generate an occupancy report for a specific date range
SELECT r.RoomType, COUNT(b.BookingID) AS BookedRooms, COUNT(r.RoomID) AS TotalRooms,
       (COUNT(b.BookingID) / COUNT(r.RoomID)) * 100 AS OccupancyRate
FROM Rooms r
LEFT JOIN Bookings b ON r.RoomID = b.RoomID
WHERE b.CheckInDate BETWEEN '2024-12-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY r.RoomType;
```

#### **Revenue Report**

To generate a revenue report based on bookings, you can sum the `PricePerNight` of rooms booked during a given period.

```sql
-- Example: Generate a revenue report for a specific date range
SELECT SUM(r.PricePerNight * DATEDIFF(b.CheckOutDate, b.CheckInDate)) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Rooms r
JOIN Bookings b ON r.RoomID = b.RoomID
WHERE b.CheckInDate BETWEEN '2024-12-01' AND '2024-12-31'
  AND b.BookingStatus = 'Completed';
```

---

### Final Notes:

- Ensure that **foreign key constraints** are properly defined to maintain data integrity between tables.
- **Triggers or Stored Procedures** can be used to automate tasks like updating availability, generating reports, or handling cancellations and overbookings.
- **Indexes** should be created on frequently queried fields (e.g., `BookingID`, `GuestID`, `RoomID`, etc.) to optimize query performance.
