Client Request:
"I own a hotel, and I need a system for managing guests, rooms, bookings, and additional services. Guests will have details like name, contact information, preferences, and booking history. Rooms will include details like room type, price per night, floor number, and availability.
Bookings should include check-in and check-out dates, payment status, and any special requests. Some bookings will include additional services like room service, spa appointments, or tours, so I need to track these separately. I’d also like to manage staff details, including their roles (e.g., housekeeping, receptionist) and schedules. Can you generate reports on room occupancy, revenue by service, and guest preferences?"

```

### **Client Request Analysis: Hotel Management System**

- **Usability:** The system must have an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for front desk staff and other hotel personnel to manage bookings, guests, and services.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure the system maintains accurate and consistent data across all modules, especially in real-time updates on room availability and service bookings.

---

### **6. User Stories and Use Cases:**

- **User Story 1:** As a **guest**, I want to make a booking for a room and specify any special requests so that my stay is comfortable and tailored to my needs.
- **User Story 2:** As a **receptionist**, I want to manage bookings and check-in guests, ensuring that room availability is accurately reflected and that guests' special requests are noted.
- **User Story 3:** As a **housekeeper**, I want to see a list of rooms that need cleaning and their status (occupied or available) so that I can efficiently manage room turnover.
- **User Story 4:** As a **hotel manager**, I want to generate revenue reports by service type, allowing me to evaluate which services are most profitable.

- **Use Case:** **Booking Management:** A guest makes a booking for a room, with details like check-in and check-out dates, payment status, and any special requests. The system checks room availability, updates the booking status, and generates a report for tracking occupancy rates.

---

### **7. Risk Assessment:**

- **Data Security:** Protecting guest details and payment status is critical. The system should comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **System Downtime:** Any downtime, especially during high booking periods, can disrupt hotel operations. Ensure the system is hosted on a reliable platform with proper backup measures.

Based on the client’s requirements, here’s a structured ERD for the Hotel Management System, covering key aspects of the system and potential corner cases.

### ERD Overview:

1. **Guests Table**:

   - `GuestID` (PK)
   - `Name`
   - `Email`
   - `PhoneNumber`
   - `Preferences`
   - `BookingHistory` (One-to-Many with Bookings)

2. **Rooms Table**:

   - `RoomID` (PK)
   - `RoomType` (Single, Double, Suite)
   - `PricePerNight`
   - `FloorNumber`
   - `AvailabilityStatus` (Available, Booked)
   - `BookingID` (FK from Bookings)

3. **Bookings Table**:

   - `BookingID` (PK)
   - `GuestID` (FK from Guests)
   - `RoomID` (FK from Rooms)
   - `CheckInDate`
   - `CheckOutDate`
   - `PaymentStatus` (Paid, Pending)
   - `SpecialRequests`
   - `BookingStatus` (Confirmed, Canceled, Completed)

4. **Services Table**:

   - `ServiceID` (PK)
   - `BookingID` (FK from Bookings)
   - `ServiceType` (Room Service, Spa, Tour)
   - `ServiceDate`
   - `Cost`
   - `ServiceStatus` (Pending, Completed, Canceled)

5. **Staff Table**:

   - `StaffID` (PK)
   - `Name`
   - `Role` (Housekeeping, Receptionist, Manager)
   - `Schedule`
   - `RoleBasedAccess` (Admin, User, etc.)

6. **Reports Table** (Virtual / Derived Data):
   - `ReportID` (PK)
   - `ReportType` (Occupancy, Revenue, Guest Preferences)
   - `DateGenerated`
   - `ReportData` (Summary Data for respective reports)

### Key Relationships:

- **Guests ↔ Bookings**: One guest can have multiple bookings.
- **Rooms ↔ Bookings**: One room can be linked to many bookings (historical).
- **Bookings ↔ Services**: One booking can have multiple services linked to it.
- **Rooms ↔ Staff**: Indirect connection for room cleaning tasks (assigned by housekeeping).
- **Staff ↔ Bookings**: Staff can be responsible for managing bookings (via receptionist role).

### Corner Case Considerations:

1. **Room Availability**: Ensure the system handles room overbooking gracefully by checking availability before confirming bookings.
2. **Multiple Bookings**: Handle guest re-booking in different seasons or events with tracking of booking history and preferences.
3. **Service Availability**: Ensure that services like spa or tours aren’t overbooked by tracking availability and limiting the number of bookings for each service type.
4. **Cancellation Handling**: Ensure that canceled bookings reflect the room as available, and all linked services are also marked as canceled.
5. **Role-Based Access**: Different staff roles must have distinct access levels, so the system must handle dynamic permissions based on roles (e.g., receptionists can manage bookings, housekeepers can manage room statuses).

### Final Notes:

- The **Reports Table** could be built as a set of virtual queries or derived data, depending on how the system generates reports.
- The **Staff Schedule** should be robust to accommodate multiple shift systems and role-based permissions.
