Client Request:
"I manage a hospital, and I need a system to organize our operations. We have patients with details like name, age, admission date, medical history, and allergies. We also have doctors with details like name, specialization, availability, and phone number. Each doctor is assigned to one or more departments (e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics), and each department has its own schedule and head doctor.
Patients book appointments with doctors, and I need to track which patient is seeing which doctor, the date, time, and any tests or prescriptions given. We also need to manage rooms in the hospital, including their type (e.g., ICU, General), availability, and assigned patients. Lastly, I’d like a report feature to show department performance, doctor schedules, and room occupancy rates."

```

### **Client Request Analysis: Hospital Management System**

---

### **1. Introduction:**

The client, a hospital manager, requires a system to efficiently organize hospital operations, including managing patient information, doctor schedules, departmental details, and room assignments.
