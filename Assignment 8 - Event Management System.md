Client Request:
"I organize events, and I need a system to manage everything. Each event will have details like name, date, location, capacity, and associated sponsors. I need to track participants with their names, contact details, and payment status. Participants should also be able to register for multiple events, and I’d like to manage team registrations for group activities.
Events might also have guest speakers, so I need their profiles with names, topics, and schedules. For venues, I’d like to track their capacity, booking status, and facilities available. Can you also include reports on revenue by event, participation trends, and sponsor contributions?"

```

8. **Event_Sponsors Table (Many-to-Many relationship):**
   - Event ID (FK - from Events)
   - Sponsor ID (FK - from Sponsors)
   - Contribution Amount

#### **Relationships:**

1. **Events ↔ Sponsors:**

   - One-to-many relationship between `Events` and `Event_Sponsors` through the `Event_Sponsors` table, which connects events to multiple sponsors.
   - A single sponsor can contribute to multiple events, and each event can have multiple sponsors.

2. **Participants ↔ Events:**

   - Many-to-many relationship between `Participants` and `Events` through the `Registrations` table, allowing participants to register for multiple events.
   - Payment status is tracked for each event registration.

3. **Participants ↔ Teams:**

   - A participant can belong to a single team via the `Registrations` table, supporting group/team registrations.
   - Teams are a group of participants registered for an event.

4. **Events ↔ Speakers:**

   - One-to-many relationship, where an event can have multiple guest speakers, and each speaker is linked to one event.
   - The `Speakers` table also includes details about the topics and timeslots of each speaker.

5. **Events ↔ Venues:**

   - One-to-one relationship between `Events` and `Venues`, ensuring that each event is associated with a specific venue.
   - A venue can host one or more events, but the system checks the `Booking Status` to ensure it is available.

6. **Event ↔ Registrations ↔ Participants:**
   - A participant may register for multiple events, which is managed through the `Registrations` table.
   - The registration status and team involvement are tracked here, and payment status for each registration is linked.

#### **Corner Cases and Considerations:**

1. **Multiple Events per Participant:**

   - The `Registrations` table allows multiple entries for a single participant for different events, with each having a distinct payment status.
   - This helps handle corner cases such as participants who register and pay for different events at varying times.

2. **Team-Based Registrations:**

   - If a participant registers for a team activity, the system must ensure that all participants under a team name are registered for the same event.
   - The `Team ID` field in the `Registrations` table ensures proper linking of participants to teams.

3. **Booking Conflicts in Venues:**

   - The `Venues` table manages the availability of each venue, and if the venue is already booked for another event, a conflict arises.
   - This can be tracked via the `Booking Status` field, which ensures that no double bookings occur.

4. **Sponsor Contributions:**

   - The `Event_Sponsors` table ensures that sponsors can contribute to multiple events, and the contribution amount is specific to each event-sponsor pair.
   - This allows detailed tracking of each sponsor's support.

5. **Payment Status Tracking:**

   - Payment status is tracked both at the participant level and at the registration level for each event. Unpaid participants should be flagged for follow-up.
   - Alerts or reports can be generated for unpaid registrations.

6. **Event Revenue Report:**
   - For generating reports, the system should consider ticket sales, sponsor contributions, and additional services (like catering or merchandising) associated with each event.
   - The report will need to aggregate data from the `Registrations`, `Event_Sponsors`, and possibly a `Revenue` table (if more details on services are included).
