Client Request:
"I’m the principal of a school, and I need a system to keep track of students, teachers, and the classes we offer. For students, I need details like ID, name, age, class, enrollment date, and their grades in each subject. Teachers should have their own profiles, including name, ID, subject specialization, and phone number.
We also offer courses that teachers can teach, and each course can have multiple sections assigned to different teachers. Students enroll in these courses, so I need to track which student is in which course and their attendance. Additionally, I’d like to manage extracurricular activities, with details on which students and teachers are involved. Later, we might want to add a feature for scheduling exams and managing results."

```
